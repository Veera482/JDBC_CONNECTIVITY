JDBC Connectivity

This repository provides examples and best practices for setting up JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect Java applications with various databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and others.

Overview

This project serves as a guide for establishing JDBC connections to different types of databases. It includes sample code for performing basic database operations and demonstrates the use of connection pooling for optimized performance.

Requirements

-Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
-Maven or Gradle for dependency management
-A database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)
-JDBC driver for your database

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jdbc-connectivity.git
    cd jdbc-connectivity
    

2. Build the project with Maven:

    bash
    mvn clean install
    
Configuration

Update the src/main/resources/database.properties file with your database details:

properties
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database
db.username=your-username
db.password=your-password

You can modify this configuration to suit different databases by changing the db.url format.

Common Issues

-Driver Not Found: Ensure the JDBC driver is included in your projectâ€™s dependencies.
-Connection Refused: Verify that your database server is running and the connection details are correct.
-Invalid Credentials: Double-check your database username and password.
